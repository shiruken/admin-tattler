## Moderation Actions

### Add Note

Mod Notes can (optionally) be added to users whose content was removed by the Reddit Admins

### Force Remove

A secondary removal can (optionally) be performed on all content removed by the Reddit Admins. This will fully remove the content from visibility in the subreddit and prevents automatic restoration in the event the user successfully appeals the Admin action.

## Limitations

* This app does not account for actions taken by Admin accounts that get *added* to a subreddit's mod team.
* Notifications will be sent when temporary bans expire if the moderator responsible for the original ban has since left the mod team. This app is only aware of *current* moderators and cannot account for the delayed `unbanuser` action that gets scheduled for temporary bans.
